## Objection Handling

### "I already use Google Drive"
> "Google Drive stores files - we help you find answers. Try searching 'What are dad's allergies?' in Google Drive. With Archevi, you get an instant answer with the source document."

### "Is my data really private?"
> "Yes - each family gets their own isolated database that's never shared. Plus, with BYOK, your AI queries go directly to Cohere. We literally never see what you search for."

### "Seems expensive"
> "Let's compare: A family of 5 on Notion pays $600+/year. Archevi is $200/year total. And unlike Notion, your data is truly private."

### "I'm not technical"
> "Neither are most of our customers! Sign up, connect your Cohere API key (we have a guide), and start uploading documents. It's designed to be as easy as Google Docs."

### "What if you go out of business?"
> "Your data is in your isolated database, and you can export everything anytime. We're building a sustainable business, but you're never locked in."
