# Pricing Strategy

## BYOK Business Model

Archevi uses a **Platform Fee + BYOK** model:

| Component | Who Pays | To Whom | Amount |
|-----------|----------|---------|--------|
| Platform Fee | Customer | Archevi | $14.99-$99+/month |
| AI Costs | Customer | Cohere directly | ~$2-10/month |

### Why BYOK?

1. **Transparency**: No hidden AI cost markups
2. **Privacy**: We never see customer queries
3. **Predictability**: Platform fee is fixed, AI costs scale with usage
4. **Trust**: Customer controls their own spending limits

## Pricing Page Copy

### Headline
> Simple, transparent pricing. Your own isolated instance + you control your AI costs.

### Subheadline
> Platform fee covers infrastructure. You pay Cohere directly for AI usage. No surprises.

### FAQ Section

**Why do I pay Cohere separately?**
> This is what makes Archevi truly private. Your queries go directly to Cohere, not through us. We never see what you search for. You also get complete transparency on AI costs - no markups.

**How much will AI cost me?**
> Most families spend $2-5/month on Cohere. A single question costs less than $0.001. You can set spending limits in your Cohere dashboard.

**Can I cancel anytime?**
> Yes. Cancel from your dashboard and your data is available for export for 30 days.
