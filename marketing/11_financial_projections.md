## Break-Even Analysis

### Monthly Break-Even Point

Fixed costs per month: $763
Variable cost per customer: $1.10
Average revenue per customer: $21.70

**Break-even customers**: $763 ÷ ($21.70 - $1.10) = **37 customers**

---

## Cash Flow Considerations

### Positive Factors
- Low upfront costs (bootstrapped)
- No inventory or physical goods
- Monthly recurring revenue (predictable)
- Annual billing (upfront cash)
- Services revenue (immediate cash)

### Negative Factors
- Payment processing delays (7-14 days)
- Seasonal fluctuations (Q1 tax season boost)
- Churn (monthly revenue loss)

### Cash Flow Strategy

1. **Encourage Annual Billing**: 15% discount drives upfront cash
2. **Services Revenue**: Migration services provide immediate revenue
3. **Low Fixed Costs**: Keep overhead minimal in Year 1
