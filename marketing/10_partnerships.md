Archevi is a secure document organization system specifically
designed for families to store and access:

The challenge: Your clients spend hours gathering these
documents for estate planning, then they end up scattered
again within months.

The solution: A centralized, searchable system that makes
estate documents accessible to the right family members.

Would you be open to a brief call to discuss how we might
help your clients stay organized?

I can offer:
- Co-branded resources for your clients

### 2. Elder Care Agencies

**Why Partner**:
- Their clients need care coordination
- Medical records management is critical
- Multiple caregivers need access
- High willingness to pay

**Value Proposition for Agencies**:
- "Coordinate care more effectively"
- Reduce caregiver miscommunication
- Better family satisfaction
- Differentiate from competitors

**Outreach Strategy**:

**Email Template**:
```
Subject: Improve care coordination for [Agency Name] clients

Hi [Name],

I'm reaching out because I built a tool that could help
your caregivers coordinate better with families.

The problem we've seen: Medical info scattered across
folders, email, and handwritten notes. Caregivers don't
have access to critical information when they need it.

Archevi provides:
- Centralized medical records
- Medication lists
- Emergency contacts
- Care plans
- Accessible to authorized caregivers

Use case: Mrs. Johnson's daughter uploads all medical
records to Archevi. Now all 3 caregivers can see her
medications, allergies, and doctor contacts - preventing
dangerous errors.

Would you be interested in a 15-minute demo?

We can provide:
- Free pilot with 5 families
- Training for your caregivers
- 20% partner discount for your clients
- Co-marketing opportunities

**Target**: 5 active agency partnerships by Month 9

### 3. Family Law Firms

**Why Partner**:
- Divorce and co-parenting clients need document organization

- Additional revenue stream

**Outreach Strategy**:

**Email Template**:
```
Subject: Document organization for your family law clients

Hi [Name],

Family law cases involve mountains of documents: custody
agreements, financial records, school forms, medical
records - and your clients need access long after the
case closes.

Archevi helps your clients:
- Organize all family documents
- Share safely with co-parents
- Access from anywhere
- Search by question ("What did we agree about summer custody?")

Use case: After divorce, parents need to reference custody
agreement regularly but can't find the email. With Archevi,
they ask "When does summer custody start?" and get instant
answers.

## Partnership Success Stories (Templates)

### Estate Lawyer Case Study
```
"Since partnering with Archevi, I've helped 50+ families
organize their estate documents. My clients love being able
to search for documents instead of digging through folders.
The 20% commission is nice, but the real value is happier
clients who stay organized long after our work is done."
- Sarah Chen, Estate Planning Attorney, Vancouver
```

### Elder Care Agency Case Study
```
"Archevi transformed how our caregivers coordinate with
families. Instead of calling the daughter every time we
need medication info, caregivers can search Archevi and
find answers instantly. It's reduced errors and improved
family satisfaction scores by 40%."
- Michael Roberts, Care Coordinator, Toronto
```

### Family Law Case Study
```
"My divorce clients used to call me months later asking
where to find the custody agreement. Now I set them up
with Archevi before the case closes. They can search for
any document or answer - and I get 20% commission for
helping them stay organized."
- Jennifer Martinez, Family Law Attorney, Ottawa
