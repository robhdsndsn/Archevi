## Why Archevi?

Every family accumulates important documents - insurance policies, medical records, tax returns, warranties, legal papers. When you need to find something specific, you're stuck digging through folders or searching file names.

**Archevi changes that.** Ask questions in plain English and get answers grounded in your actual documents:

> "What's our home insurance deductible?"
> "When does Sarah's passport expire?"
> "What did the doctor recommend at my last checkup?"

No more hunting through PDFs. No more forgotten expiration dates. Your documents become a searchable knowledge base that actually understands what's inside them.

## How It Works

1. **Upload your documents** - PDFs, scanned images, or type directly
2. **AI processes everything** - Automatic categorization, tagging, and expiry detection
3. **Ask questions naturally** - "When does my car insurance expire?"
4. **Get cited answers** - Responses reference your actual documents

Your documents are encrypted and stored securely. Each family's data is completely isolated.
