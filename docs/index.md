## Why Archevi?

Stop losing important family information. Stop paying for tools that weren't built for families. Stop worrying about who can see your data.

Archevi is your family's **private, AI-powered knowledge base**:

- **"What was grandma's cookie recipe?"** - Instant answers from your family's documents
- **"Where's the home insurance policy?"** - Found in seconds, not folders
- **"What are dad's allergies?"** - Searchable medical history for caregivers
- **"When does the car registration expire?"** - Never miss important dates

## How It Works

### 1. Sign Up & Connect
Create your account and connect your own Cohere API key. You control your AI costs directly.

### 2. Your Private Instance Spins Up
Within 60 seconds, you get your own isolated database at `yourfamily.archevi.ca`. No one else can access it.

### 3. Start Adding Knowledge
Upload documents, paste text, or just type. Our AI automatically organizes and indexes everything.

### 4. Ask Anything
Chat naturally with your family's knowledge base. Get instant, accurate answers with source citations.
