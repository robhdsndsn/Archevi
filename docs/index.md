## Why Archevi?

Stop losing important family information. Stop paying for tools that weren't built for families. Stop worrying about who can see your data.

Archevi is your family's **private, AI-powered knowledge base**:

- **"What was grandma's cookie recipe?"** - Instant answers from your family's documents
- **"Where's the home insurance policy?"** - Found in seconds, not folders
- **"What are dad's allergies?"** - Searchable medical history for caregivers
- **"When does the car registration expire?"** - Never miss important dates
- **"Show me all of Sarah's documents"** - Filter by family member

## How It Works

### 1. Sign Up
Create your account. No API key required - AI is included in every plan.

### 2. Your Private Instance Spins Up
Within 60 seconds, you get your own isolated database. No one else can access it.

### 3. Start Adding Knowledge
Upload PDFs, snap photos, record voice notes, or paste text. Our AI automatically categorizes, tags, and detects expiry dates.

### 4. Ask Anything
Chat naturally with your family's knowledge base. Watch the AI work in real-time and see exactly which documents it uses.
