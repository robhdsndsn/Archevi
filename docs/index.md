Archevi is your family's **private, AI-powered knowledge base**:

- **"What was grandma's cookie recipe?"** - Instant answers from your family's documents
- **"Where's the home insurance policy?"** - Found in seconds, not folders
- **"What are dad's allergies?"** - Searchable medical history for caregivers
- **"When does the car registration expire?"** - Never miss important dates

### 3. Start Adding Knowledge
Upload documents, paste text, or just type. Our AI automatically organizes and indexes everything.

### 4. Ask Anything
Chat naturally with your family's knowledge base. Get instant, accurate answers with source citations.
