# Pricing

Simple, transparent pricing. Your own isolated instance + you control your AI costs.

## How Pricing Works

Archevi uses a **BYOK (Bring Your Own Key)** model:

1. **Platform Fee** - You pay us for infrastructure and the platform
2. **AI Costs** - You pay Cohere directly for your AI usage

This means complete cost transparency and you only pay for what you use.

## FAQ

### Why do I need my own Cohere API key?

This is what makes Archevi truly private. When you use your own API key:
- Your queries go directly to Cohere, not through us
- We can't see what you're asking or searching for
- You have full control over your AI spending
- No usage limits imposed by us

### How do I get a Cohere API key?

It takes 2 minutes:
1. Go to [cohere.com](https://cohere.com)
2. Create a free account
3. Navigate to API Keys
4. Copy your key into Archevi settings

### What if I use a lot of AI queries?

You're in control. Cohere's pricing is very affordable:
- Embed (search): $0.10 per million tokens
- Generate (answers): $0.50-2.50 per million tokens

A typical family question costs less than $0.001 (a tenth of a cent).

### Can I cancel anytime?

Yes, cancel anytime from your dashboard. Your data export is always available.

### Is there a free trial?

Yes! 14-day free trial with full features. You'll still need a Cohere API key (they have a free tier too).
