# Getting Started

Welcome to Archevi! Get your family's AI-powered knowledge base running in 60 seconds.

## What is Archevi?

Archevi is a **private, AI-powered family knowledge base** that gives you:

- **Instant answers** - Ask questions in natural language, watch AI find answers in real-time
- **Complete privacy** - Your own isolated database, no data sharing
- **Privacy controls** - Set who sees what: Everyone, Adults Only, Admins Only, or Private
- **Zero friction** - Works immediately, no API key setup required
- **Enterprise security** - PIPEDA compliant, Canadian-hosted

## How It Works

1. **Sign up** - Create your Archevi account
2. **Your instance spins up** - Private database for your family only
3. **Start adding knowledge** - Upload PDFs, snap photos, record voice notes, or paste text
4. **Ask anything** - Get instant answers with source citations

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Create Your Account

[Sign up for Archevi](https://archevi.ca/signup) and choose your plan.

### Step 2: Complete Onboarding

After signup, you'll be guided through:
- Inviting family members
- Uploading your first documents
- Asking your first question

That's it! You're ready to start in under 60 seconds.

## AI Costs: Included

Unlike other services, Archevi includes AI usage in your subscription:

| Plan | Included AI Allowance |
|------|----------------------|
| Starter ($14.99/mo) | $3.00/month (~150 queries) |
| Family ($24.99/mo) | $8.00/month (~400 queries) |
| Family Office | Unlimited |

Most families never exceed their included allowance. If you do, overages are billed at $0.01 per 1,000 tokens (roughly $0.01 per query).

## Optional: Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)

For privacy-conscious users, you can optionally use your own Cohere API key:

- **Your queries go directly to Cohere** - We never see what you search for
- **You control costs** - Pay Cohere directly
- **Extra privacy** - AI processing happens with YOUR key

[Set up BYOK (optional)](/guide/byok-setup)

Archevi works great for:

- Medical records and prescriptions
- Insurance policies and claims
- Financial documents
