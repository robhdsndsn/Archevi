## How It Works

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Create Your Account

[Sign up for Archevi](https://archevi.ca/signup) and choose your plan.

### Step 2: Set Up Your Cohere API Key

You'll need your own Cohere API key (this is what makes Archevi truly private).

[Follow our Cohere setup guide](/guide/cohere-setup)

### Step 3: Complete Onboarding

After signup, you'll be guided through:

## Why BYOK (Bring Your Own Key)?

When you use your own Cohere API key:

- **Your queries go directly to Cohere** - We never see what you search for
- **You control costs** - Pay Cohere directly, no markups
- **Extra privacy** - AI processing happens with YOUR key
- **No limits** - Query as much as your budget allows

Typical usage is **$2-5/month** in AI costs.
