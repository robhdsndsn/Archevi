# Medical Records

One of Archevi's most powerful use cases: managing family health information.

## The Problem

- Multiple family members with different doctors
- Prescriptions change frequently
- Hard to remember allergies and conditions
- Emergency situations require quick access
- Caregivers need accurate information

## The Solution

Upload medical documents and ask questions like:

- "What medications is mom taking?"
- "When was dad's last checkup?"
- "What are the kids' allergies?"
- "What was the diagnosis from the specialist?"

## What to Upload

### Essential Documents
- Current medication lists
- Allergy information
- Vaccination records
- Insurance cards (text or transcribed)
- Emergency contacts

### Helpful Additions
- Doctor visit summaries
- Lab results
- Specialist consultations
- Prescription instructions
- Medical history timelines

## Example Workflow

### 1. Create a Document

**Title:** "Mom's Current Medications (Nov 2024)"

**Category:** Medical

**Content:**
```
Current Medications for Jane Doe (Mom)

1. Metformin 500mg - Take twice daily with meals (diabetes)
2. Lisinopril 10mg - Take once daily in morning (blood pressure)
3. Vitamin D 2000IU - Take once daily (deficiency)

### 2. Ask Questions

- "What blood pressure medication does mom take?"
- "Is mom allergic to any antibiotics?"
- "What's Dr. Smith's phone number?"

### 3. Keep Updated

When medications change, upload a new document with the current date. Archevi will prioritize recent information.

## For Caregivers

If you have elderly parents or family members with caregivers:

1. Give caregivers read-only access
