## Why These Use Cases Work

Archevi shines when you need to:

1. **Find information quickly** - Natural language search means no more digging through folders
2. **Control who sees what** - Privacy controls let you share recipes with everyone while keeping finances adults-only
3. **Assign to people** - Medical records go to specific family members
4. **Never miss dates** - Expiry alerts for insurance renewals, passport expirations, and more

## Privacy Controls by Use Case

| Use Case | Suggested Visibility | Why |
|----------|---------------------|-----|
| Recipes | Everyone | Share with the whole family |
| Medical Records | Private or Adults Only | Personal health info |
| Financial Docs | Adults Only | Keep from kids |
| Legal Documents | Admins Only | Sensitive matters |
| Family Stories | Everyone | Share memories |

## Real-World Examples

> "We uploaded all of grandma's recipes as 'Everyone' visibility. Now the kids can look up recipes themselves!"

> "My dad has complex medications. I set his records to 'Private' so only he and I (as admin) can see them. Caregivers get a summary I share separately."

> "Financial documents are 'Adults Only' so our teens can't access them, but my spouse and I both can."
