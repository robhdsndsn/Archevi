# What Canadian family tech companies, parenting apps, or senior care platforms have raised funding in 2024-2025? Who are their investors?

Based on my comprehensive search, I now have enough information to provide a detailed answer about Canadian family tech companies, parenting apps, and senior care platforms that have raised funding in 2024-2025.

## Canadian Family Tech, Parenting Apps, and Senior Care Platforms with 2024-2025 Funding

### Family Estate and Wealth Management

**Trusty Estate**[^1_1][^1_2][^1_3]

Trusty is a Toronto-based AI-powered estate planning platform that raised **\$1 million in pre-seed funding in July 2025**. The platform helps families manage and protect their wealth across generations by using artificial intelligence for image recognition, document analysis, and a conversational assistant called "Max" to help users digitize their valuables, interpret legal documents, and record personal video messages for loved ones.

**Lead Investors:** Relay Ventures, Graphite Ventures[^1_3][^1_1]

**Additional Investors:** Mistral Venture Partners and strategic angel investors[^1_1]

**Use of Funds:** The company will accelerate product development and go-to-market efforts across North America, including advancements to Trusty's AI asset detection, in-app assistant, and proprietary estate workflows with wealth and estate professionals.[^1_1]

***

**Wealthsimple**[^1_4][^1_5][^1_6]

Wealthsimple, the Toronto-based fintech platform serving millions of Canadians with investing, spending, and financial management tools, announced a **Series E round of \$750 million CAD in October 2025**, achieving a **\$10 billion valuation**. While Wealthsimple is primarily a personal finance platform, it serves families and includes tools for household financial management.

**Lead Investors:** Dragoneer Investment Group (US), GIC (Singapore sovereign wealth fund)[^1_5][^1_6][^1_4]

**Additional Investors:** Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPP Investments - new investor), Power Corporation of Canada, IGM Financial Inc., ICONIQ, Greylock, and Meritech[^1_6][^1_4][^1_5]

**Key Metrics:** Wealthsimple reached \$100 billion in assets under administration in October 2025, doubling from \$50 billion in 2024. The company reported profitability in both 2024 and 2025.[^1_4][^1_6]

***

### Senior Care and Caregiver Support Platforms

**Trualta Care Network**[^1_7][^1_8][^1_9]

Trualta is an Ottawa-based senior and family caregiver support platform that received **\$7 million in FedDev Ontario funding in March 2025** as part of the federal government's initiative to support tech companies scaling up and commercializing products in the Ottawa region.[^1_7]

The platform provides online learning modules for family caregivers, offering training on hands-on care, safety and fall prevention, dementia care support, and caregiver wellness. Trualta operates in partnership with healthcare payers, providers, and social service organizations to deliver skills-based training to caregivers.[^1_10][^1_9]

**Funding Source:** FedDev Ontario (federal economic development funding)[^1_7]

**Previous Support:** Trualta also received \$598,795 in Industrial Research Assistance Program (IRAP) funding from the National Research Council Canada for developing a proprietary analytics framework between January 2023 and May 2024.[^1_8]

***

### Business and Financial Management Tools for Families

**Loop Financial**[^1_11][^1_12][^1_7]

Loop is a Toronto-based fintech startup focused on cross-border banking and international financial management for small businesses. Though not exclusively a "family" company, it serves entrepreneurs and small business owners managing household and business finances.

Loop announced a **\$6.4 million CAD seed extension round in September 2024**, bringing total funding to over **\$10 million CAD**.[^1_12][^1_11]

**Investors:** Luge Capital, Graphite Ventures, Conconi Growth Partners, Mistral Venture Partners, Wedbush Ventures, and Web Ventures[^1_11][^1_12]

**Use of Funds:** International expansion and product improvements to support cross-border payments and treasury management for small businesses.[^1_12][^1_11]

***

### Key Findings on Canadian Family Tech Funding

**Government Support for Aging and Family Care:** Beyond venture-backed startups, Canada has established significant government funding streams for family caregiving and senior care infrastructure. The federal government allocated \$60.3 million through the 2024-25 National Seniors Strategy Community-Based Stream for 2,905 community projects supporting seniors in over 400 communities.[^1_13]

**AgeTech Ecosystem Growth:** Two major funding initiatives for senior care technology were launched in 2024:[^1_14][^1_15]

- **EnvisAGE** contributed **\$5 million** across 16 AgeTech projects (with total industry partner investment value of nearly \$20 million) through funding received from the Government of Canada's Strategic Innovation Fund.[^1_14]
- **CABHI's Ignite Program** launched in October 2024, providing **\$50,000 to \$150,000 CAD** to early-stage Canadian innovators developing solutions for older persons, particularly those addressing dementia care needs.[^1_15]

**Fintech Trends:** Canadian fintech received record investment of US\$9.5 billion across 121 deals in 2024, though this sector is broader than family-focused solutions. Family-focused financial tools like Wealthsimple continue to attract significant institutional investment from global and Canadian sources.[^1_16]

**Parent Tech Investment Growth:** A 2022 report indicated the parent tech sector in Canada received over three times more venture capital dollars in 2021 than in the previous six years combined, though specific 2024-2025 funding announcements for dedicated parenting apps were limited in available data.[^1_17]

The Canadian family tech ecosystem shows growing government support for caregiver and senior care solutions, while family wealth management and financial services continue to attract significant private venture capital investment.
