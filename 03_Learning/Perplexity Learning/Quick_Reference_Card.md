# Perplexity Spaces & Labs Quick Reference Card

**One-page guide for efficient execution**

## WHEN TO USE WHAT

| Task | Use | Why |
|------|-----|-----|
| Exploratory research | **Space Query** | Fast, conversational, good for Q&A |
| Multi-component deliverable | **Labs** | Generates dashboards, decks, toolkits (10-30 min wait) |
| Quick fact-check | **Space Query** | Immediate answer, cite-able sources |
| Complex asset creation | **Labs** | Automated generation of templates, calendars, etc. |

**Rule of Thumb:**
- If you need an answer → Space Query (2-5 min)
- If you need a deliverable → Labs (15-30 min)

## WORKFLOW CHEAT SHEET

### Setting Up a Space (5 min)
1. Create new Space in Perplexity Pro
2. Upload files (drag & drop)
3. Copy custom instructions from guide
4. Paste into Space settings
5. Run test query to validate

### Running a Space Query (2-5 min)
1. Open Space
2. Type/paste query
3. Wait for response (usually <1 min)
4. Copy output to organized folder
5. Update tracking spreadsheet

### Running a Labs Deliverable (15-30 min)
1. Open Space
2. Click "Labs" button (beaker icon)
3. Paste full prompt from library
4. Submit and wait (10-30 min)
5. Review output for accuracy
6. Download/copy all components
7. Update tracking spreadsheet

### Iterating on Labs Output
1. Use follow-up prompts in same Labs session
2. Example: "Expand section 3 with more examples"
3. Example: "Provide this as a CSV table instead"
4. Download updated output
5. Mark as complete when satisfied

---

## TIPS FOR BETTER OUTPUTS

### Writing Effective Prompts
✅ **Do:**
- Be specific: "Create a table with columns X, Y, Z"
- Reference files: "Based on the ProductHunt case studies..."
- Specify format: "Provide as markdown" or "Format as CSV"
- Set constraints: "150-200 words" or "At least 10 examples"
- Request structure: "Use H1/H2/H3 hierarchy"

❌ **Don't:**
- Be vague: "Tell me about competitors"
- Assume context: Always reference uploaded files explicitly
- Accept generic output: Push back with "Be more specific to Canadian families"

### Common Issues & Fixes

| Issue | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| Output too generic | Prompt lacks context | Add "For Canadian market targeting families with elder care needs" |
| Missing data | Perplexity didn't read files | Explicitly reference: "Based on the X document, section Y..." |
| Wrong format | Didn't specify | Request: "Provide as a markdown table" or "Format as checklist" |
| Too short | No length guidance | Specify: "At least 500 words" or "Include 10+ examples" |
| Inaccurate data | Labs hallucinated | Cross-check against uploaded docs, iterate with corrections |

## KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS & PRODUCTIVITY HACKS

### Perplexity Pro Desktop App
- **Ctrl/Cmd + N** - New conversation (quick switch between Spaces)
- **Ctrl/Cmd + K** - Search Spaces
- **Ctrl/Cmd + /** - Open Labs

### Workflow Hacks
- **Batch uploads:** Upload all files to a Space at once (drag & drop multiple)
- **Template queries:** Save common query patterns in a text file for quick copy-paste
- **Parallel Labs:** Run Labs in 2+ Spaces simultaneously (different browser tabs)
- **Version control:** Save Labs outputs with timestamps (e.g., `Launch_Campaign_v1_2025-12-02.md`)
- **Quick validation:** Use Ctrl+F to search uploaded docs for claims made by Labs

### File Naming Convention
- **Space Queries:** `[Topic]_[Date].md` (e.g., `Competitive_Positioning_Matrix_2025-12-02.md`)
- **Labs Deliverables:** `[Deliverable_Name]/[Component].ext` (e.g., `Launch_Campaign/Gantt_Chart.csv`)
- **Versions:** Append `_v1`, `_v2` if iterating (e.g., `Pricing_Strategy_v2.md`)

## EMERGENCY TROUBLESHOOTING

### Labs Not Working
1. Check if files are uploaded to Space
2. Ensure custom instructions are set
3. Try shorter prompt (break into parts)
4. Switch to new browser tab
5. Contact Perplexity support

### Output Quality Issues
1. Add more context to prompt
2. Explicitly reference uploaded files
3. Request specific format/structure
4. Use follow-up prompts to refine
5. Cross-check data against source docs

### Time Management
1. Focus on P0 deliverables first (Weeks 1-2)
2. Batch similar tasks (set up all Spaces in one session)
3. Use Labs' wait time productively (run multiple Labs in parallel)
4. Don't perfectionism - aim for 80% complete, iterate later
