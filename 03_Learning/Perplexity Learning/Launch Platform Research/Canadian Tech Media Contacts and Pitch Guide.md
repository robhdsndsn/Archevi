# What Canadian tech newsletters, podcasts, or publications have featured productivity or family tech products in 2024-2025? Who are the editors and how do they prefer pitches?

Now I have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer. Let me compile the research findings about Canadian tech newsletters, podcasts, and publications that have featured productivity or family tech products.

## Canadian Tech Newsletters, Podcasts, and Publications Featuring Productivity or Family Tech Products (2024-2025)

### **Major Publications \& News Outlets**

**BetaKit**[^1_1]
The publication of record for Canadian tech and startup news. Editor-in-Chief Douglas Soltys founded the independent version in 2016 and continues to lead it. BetaKit launched "Most Ambitious," an annual issue spotlighting innovation across Canada, and has published productivity-related coverage.

*Pitch Guidelines:* Soltys emphasizes that founders should pitch stories with compelling narratives and demonstrate understanding of what BetaKit covers. Direct pitches through their contact form on BetaKit.com or individual journalist bios work best. Focus on actual news rather than company announcements.[^1_2]

**The Logic**[^1_3][^1_4]
A subscription-based innovation economy news publication founded in 2018 by David Skok (CEO and Editor-in-Chief). Headquartered in Toronto with bureaus in Vancouver, Calgary, Ottawa, and Montreal, The Logic covers businesses, people, and policies driving transformational change. Their subscription model (\$299/year) ensures editorial independence.

*Pitch Preferences:* Email pitches should target specific reporters and demonstrate familiarity with The Logic's coverage style. They focus on innovation economy stories rather than straight product launches.[^1_3]

### **Pitch Preferences - Key Takeaways**

**What Canadian Tech Journalists Want:**[^1_32][^1_2]

- Actual news and story angles, not company announcements
- Tailored pitches demonstrating familiarity with their coverage
- Clear, concise emails without marketing jargon
- Early notification (5-7 business days advance for timely pieces)
- Direct contact through published channels (forms, individual journalist emails)
- Stories about founders' journeys, policy impacts, and innovation driving change
- Exclusive information or unique perspectives when possible

**Worst Practices to Avoid:**

- Generic mass pitches
- Starting emails with "I have a pitch for you"
- Pitching topics without a specific news angle
- Contacting multiple editors simultaneously
- Failing to research the publication's previous coverage

Most Canadian tech media outlets prefer email pitches sent to specific editors during business hours. Doing your homework on what each publication covers will significantly increase your chances of coverage.
