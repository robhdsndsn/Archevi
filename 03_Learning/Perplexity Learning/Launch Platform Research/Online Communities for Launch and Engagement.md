# Find online communities (Facebook Groups, Discord servers, Slack workspaces, subreddits) focused on family organization, elder care coordination, or estate planning that have grown significantly in 2024-2025.

Now I have gathered sufficient information. Let me compile a comprehensive report on online communities focused on family organization, elder care coordination, and estate planning that have grown significantly in 2024-2025.

## Online Communities Focused on Family Organization, Elder Care, and Estate Planning Growing in 2024-2025

Online communities supporting caregiving, elder care coordination, and family organization have experienced substantial growth in 2024-2025, driven by the expanding caregiver population and increasing demand for peer support and resources.

### **Reddit Communities: The Largest Growth**

**r/AgingParents** stands as one of the largest caregiving-related subreddits, ranking in the top 4% of all subreddits by size with approximately 60,000-61,000 members. This community has demonstrated year-over-year growth of approximately 66.4%, with members primarily discussing the experiences of caring for aging parents. The subreddit focuses on functional problems of care recipients, caregiving relationship strain, and care recipients' emotional problems as primary topics of discussion.[^1_1][^1_2]

**r/eldercare** has grown significantly, with approximately 11,000 members and a 97.7% year-over-year increase in membership. This emotional support community serves as a forum for asking questions and sharing stories about elder care. The subreddit shows active engagement with themes including advice requests ("Caregivers need care too"), pain and anger about elder care challenges, and solution-focused posts about hiring caregivers and managing financial aspects of elder care.[^1_3]

**r/elderlycare**, a smaller but specialized community, has approximately 2,200 members and focuses specifically on supporting informal caregivers of older adults beyond just parent-child relationships. Additional caregiving subreddits include r/CaregiverSupport with 34,000 members, r/caregivers with 7,000 members, and condition-specific communities like r/Alzheimers and r/dementia. A 2025 peer-reviewed study analyzing these subreddits found that caregiver posts frequently disclosed care recipients' functional problems (67.8%), caregiving relationship strain (37.9%), and care recipients' emotional problems (26.4%).[^1_4][^1_1]

### **Facebook Groups: Established Networks with Steady Engagement**

**Working Daughter**, a prominent Facebook-based community for women balancing parent caregiving with careers, continues to be a major hub for the working caregiver demographic. Founded by author and caregiving expert Liz O'Donnell, this group provides an interactive portal, Facebook group, and podcast content specifically addressing the intersection of caregiving and employment.[^1_5][^1_6][^1_7]

**Memory People™**, an Alzheimer's/dementia-specific group created in November 2010, serves as one of the most established caregiving communities on Facebook, emphasizing realistic discussions about dementia and memory impairment support.[^1_5]

**Caregivers Hub Support Group** and **Alzheimer's and Dementia Support** are among other popular Facebook groups mentioned in 2025 caregiver resources.[^1_8]

**Care for Elderly Parents Canada** represents regional variations of this community structure, with geographically-focused support groups enabling localized sharing and advice exchange.[^1_9]

### **Emerging Platform Growth: Wellthy Community**

**Wellthy Community**, a peer network platform launched in 2022, has demonstrated exceptional growth trajectory in 2024-2025. The company reported a **66% year-over-year increase in the number of Wellthy members creating Community accounts**, with community posts increasing by approximately 50% compared to 2022 levels. The most popular Wellthy Community forum focused on Aging, corresponding to the most frequent caregiving task category on the platform. The platform shows that 65% of active caregiving projects are started by women, with "daughter" and "mother" being top roles for members, reflecting national caregiving gender patterns.[^1_10]

### **Discord Servers for Caregiver Support**

A **Caregiver Support Discord server** is referenced in r/CaregiverSupport subreddit resources, available through the subreddit's sidebar links (as of June 2025). Additionally, multiple caregiving-focused Discord communities exist, including the **Collection of Caregivers** server described as an inclusive 18+ verified community with various channels, roles, and both caregiver and littles-specific areas, featuring active voice chats and streaming sections.[^1_11][^1_12]

Other Discord communities referenced include those focused on peer support for disease-specific caregiving (such as the Beat Cancer Discord Community created for Adolescents and Young Adults affected by cancer), demonstrating the platform's growing adoption for health-related peer support.[^1_13]

### **Slack Workspace Applications**

While Slack is less commonly used than Discord for public caregiving communities, innovative applications have emerged. **Kensington Place**, an assisted-living community in Redwood City, California, established private Slack channels connecting residents with family members, enabling daily updates through a channel-based messaging system during the pandemic and beyond. This model demonstrates how Slack can facilitate family coordination and elder care communication at the institutional level.[^1_14][^1_15]

### **National Context: Explosive Growth in Caregiver Population**

The growth of these communities reflects dramatic demographic changes. According to the 2025 AARP and National Alliance for Caregiving report, **63 million Americans are now family caregivers**—a **45-50% increase since 2015**—with nearly one in four American adults holding caregiving responsibilities. This expansion has driven corresponding demand for online support communities, as caregivers seek peer connection, practical advice, and emotional support.[^1_16][^1_17][^1_10]

### **Emerging Concerns and Future Directions**

The growth in these communities coincides with increased attention to **digital asset and estate planning**, with fewer than 15% of Americans possessing estate plans that address digital assets. Estate planning communities, while smaller than caregiving communities, are beginning to emerge as the Millennial and Gen Z populations advance into wealth-building years and face complex decisions about digital legacy planning.[^1_18][^1_19]

Online caregiver communities have proven to be particularly effective for providing **informational support** (practical advice) and **emotional support** (validation, encouragement), though these platforms struggle to provide tangible support requiring physical proximity. Research indicates that caregiver communities on Reddit and similar platforms are increasingly recognized as critical infrastructure for addressing caregiver burnout and isolation in an aging society.[^1_20][^1_1]
