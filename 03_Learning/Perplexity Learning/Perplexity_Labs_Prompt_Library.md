## LAB 6: Pricing Strategy Toolkit
**Run in:** Space 6 (Pricing and Monetization Intelligence)
**Priority:** P0 (Critical for launch)
**Estimated Time:** 15-20 minutes
**Expected Outputs:** Pricing comparison chart, calculator mock, conversion funnel, competitor monitor, unit economics model

### FULL PROMPT:
```
Create a comprehensive pricing strategy toolkit for Archevi to validate and optimize our dual-model pricing (SaaS + SaaS).

CURRENT PRICING:
- Starter: $14.99 CAD/month (1-3 family members, 5GB storage, basic features)
- Family: $24.99 CAD/month (unlimited members, 25GB storage, premium features)
- SaaS: Free (deploy on-premiseed, all features, enterprise deployment/support)

COMPONENT 1: Competitive Pricing Comparison Chart
Create a detailed comparison table:
- Columns: Competitor Name | Plan Name | Price (USD) | Price (CAD, 1.35x) | Storage | Users | Key Features | Value Metric | Archevi Positioning
- Include at least 10 competitors from the uploaded "Competitor Pricing" document
- For each competitor, identify:
  * How they price (per user? flat rate? per GB?)
  * What features are gated (free vs paid tiers)
  * Where Archevi sits (cheaper? more expensive? better value?)
  * Our differentiation (what we offer that they don't)

Visual output:
- A "Pricing Landscape" chart showing:
  * X-axis: Price (CAD per month)
  * Y-axis: Feature richness (1-10 scale)
  * Plotted points: Archevi + 10 competitors
  * Quadrants: Budget / Value / Premium / Overpriced
  * Archevi should ideally sit in "Value" quadrant (mid-price, high features)

COMPONENT 2: Interactive Pricing Calculator (Mock Design)
Design a pricing calculator for the website:

USER INPUTS:
- Number of family members (slider: 1-10)
- Storage needed (slider: 1GB-100GB)
- Features needed (checkboxes: OCR, Voice Notes, AI Categorization, Expiry Alerts, etc.)
- Data isolation preference (toggle: Yes/No)

OUTPUT:
- Recommended plan (Starter / Family / SaaS)
- Monthly cost (if SaaS)
- Annual savings (if they pay yearly - offer 20% discount)
- Comparison to competitors ("Save $X/month vs [Competitor]")
- CTA: "Start Free Trial" or "Download SaaS"

Provide:
- Wireframe description (layout, inputs, outputs)
- Logic rules (when to recommend each plan)
- Copy for each output (e.g., "Based on your needs, we recommend the Family plan")
- A/B test ideas (e.g., show competitor comparison vs not)

COMPONENT 3: Conversion Funnel Analysis
Map the pricing page journey:

STAGE 1: ARRIVAL (Pricing page traffic sources)
- Organic search (keyword: "family document management pricing")
- ProductHunt launch (direct traffic)
- Blog content (internal links from comparison pages)
- Paid ads (Google, Facebook)

STAGE 2: CONSIDERATION (User actions on pricing page)
- View pricing table (80% of visitors)
- Use pricing calculator (30% of visitors)
- Read FAQs (40% of visitors)
- Compare plans (50% of visitors)
- Click "Start Free Trial" (10% → CONVERSION)

STAGE 3: CONVERSION (Signup flow)
- Enter email (10% of pricing page visitors start here)
- Choose plan (8% select a plan)
- Enter payment info (6% complete signup)
- Confirm account (5% activate and use product)

STAGE 4: RETENTION (Upgrade/churn behavior)
- Starter → Family upgrade (target: 20% within 3 months)
- Free trial → Paid conversion (target: 30% after 14 days)
- Churn rate (target: < 5% monthly)

For each stage, provide:
- Current industry benchmarks (based on uploaded open-core case studies)
- Archevi targets (realistic goals for first 6 months)
- Optimization ideas (how to improve each stage)
- Red flags (signals of a problem, e.g., "If < 5% click trial, pricing may be too high")

COMPONENT 4: Competitor Price Monitoring Template
Create a spreadsheet to track competitor pricing over time:

COLUMNS:
- Competitor Name
- Plan Name
- Price (USD)
- Price (CAD)
- Last Updated
- Change from Previous ($ and %)
- Features Added/Removed
- Market Signal (Are they raising prices? Lowering? Adding free tier?)
- Archevi Response (Should we adjust our pricing?)

Include:
- Sample rows (5 competitors with fictitious price changes)
- Update frequency (check monthly)
- Alert triggers (e.g., "If competitor drops price by >20%, review our pricing")

COMPONENT 5: Unit Economics Model
Build a financial model to validate pricing sustainability:

REVENUE INPUTS:
- Average revenue per user (ARPU): $19.99 CAD (weighted average of Starter/Family mix)
- Customer lifetime (months): 24 (assumption)
- Customer lifetime value (LTV): ARPU x Lifetime = $479.76 CAD

COST INPUTS:
- Cohere API costs (embedding + generation): $0.50 per user per month (assumption)
- Hosting (per user): $1.00 per month (Windmill, PostgreSQL, CDN)
- Support (per user): $2.00 per month (customer service time)
- Marketing (CAC - customer acquisition cost): $50 CAD (ProductHunt, ads, content)
- Total cost per user per month: $3.50 (variable) + CAC (one-time)

PROFITABILITY METRICS:
- Gross margin: (ARPU - variable costs) / ARPU = ($19.99 - $3.50) / $19.99 = 82.5%
- LTV:CAC ratio: $479.76 / $50 = 9.6:1 (excellent if > 3:1)
- Months to payback CAC: $50 / ($19.99 - $3.50) = 3.0 months (good if < 12 months)
- Break-even users: Fixed costs (assume $5,000/month for team) / (ARPU - variable costs) = 303 users

Provide:
- Table with inputs and outputs
- Sensitivity analysis (what if CAC doubles? What if churn increases?)
- Profitability targets (when do we hit break-even? 100 users? 500 users?)
- Pricing experiment ideas (e.g., "Test $17.99 Starter tier - would lower CAC attract more users?")

COMPONENT 6: Pricing Validation Checklist
Before launch, validate pricing with these checks:

MARKET VALIDATION:
- [ ] Priced within 20% of direct competitors (not too high/low)
- [ ] Value metric aligns with customer perception (they understand what they're paying for)
- [ ] Canadian pricing feels "fair" (not just USD conversion, consider purchasing power)
- [ ] Discount structure is sustainable (20% annual discount is common, manageable)

PSYCHOLOGICAL PRICING:
- [ ] Use charm pricing ($14.99, not $15.00)
- [ ] Anchor high (show Family plan first, makes Starter feel like a deal)
- [ ] Limit choices (3 tiers max - avoid paradox of choice)
- [ ] Highlight most popular (badge "Most Popular" on Family plan)

BUSINESS MODEL VALIDATION:
- [ ] LTV:CAC > 3:1 (sustainable growth)
- [ ] Gross margin > 75% (SaaS benchmark)
- [ ] Payback period < 12 months (can reinvest quickly)
- [ ] Churn rate < 5% monthly (sticky product)

OPEN-CORE BALANCE:
- [ ] Free (SaaS) has enough value to attract users (not crippled)
- [ ] Paid tiers have clear differentiation (convenience, support, managed hosting)
- [ ] Free users can become advocates (recommend paid version to others)
- [ ] Upgrade path is obvious (free users know how to upgrade when ready)

COMPONENT 7: Pricing Experiments Roadmap
Plan 3 pricing experiments to run post-launch:

EXPERIMENT 1: Annual Discount Test
- Hypothesis: Offering 20% annual discount increases LTV and reduces churn
- Test: Show annual option prominently on pricing page (A/B test: 10% vs 20% discount)
- Success metric: >30% choose annual over monthly
- Timeline: Month 1-2 post-launch

EXPERIMENT 2: Starter Tier Price Test
- Hypothesis: Lowering Starter to $12.99 increases signups without cannibalizing Family tier
- Test: A/B test $14.99 vs $12.99 Starter (50/50 split)
- Success metric: 20% increase in Starter signups, <5% decrease in Family signups
- Timeline: Month 3-4 post-launch

EXPERIMENT 3: Feature Gate Test
- Hypothesis: Moving AI categorization from Starter to Family increases upgrades
- Test: A/B test current feature split vs new split
- Success metric: 10% increase in Starter → Family upgrades
- Timeline: Month 5-6 post-launch

For each experiment, provide:
- Detailed test plan (control vs variant)
- Sample size needed (statistical significance)
- Duration (how long to run)
- Decision criteria (what result triggers a change?)

FORMAT: Provide as:
- Comparison chart: Table (Competitor | Plan | Price | Features | Positioning)
- Calculator: Wireframe description + logic rules
- Funnel: Diagram or table (Stage | Metric | Benchmark | Target | Optimization Ideas)
- Monitoring template: Spreadsheet (Competitor | Price | Change | Response)
- Unit economics: Financial model (Inputs | Calculations | Outputs)
- Validation checklist: Markdown checkboxes
- Experiments roadmap: Table (Experiment | Hypothesis | Test | Metric | Timeline)

Use data from the uploaded "Competitor Pricing" and "Open-Core Pricing Models" documents to inform benchmarks and best practices.
```

### SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- ✅ Pricing comparison includes at least 10 competitors with CAD conversion
- ✅ Calculator design is detailed enough to hand off to a developer
- ✅ Conversion funnel identifies specific drop-off points and optimization ideas
- ✅ Unit economics model shows path to profitability
- ✅ Validation checklist covers market, psychological, and business model factors
- ✅ Experiments are specific and measurable (not vague "test pricing" ideas)

## LAB 7: Technical Differentiation Messaging Kit
**Run in:** Space 7 (Technical Landscape and Differentiation)
**Priority:** P1 (Important, not launch-blocking)
**Estimated Time:** 15-20 minutes
**Expected Outputs:** Privacy explainer, RAG diagram, decision matrix, FAQ generator, dev pitch deck

### FULL PROMPT:
```
Create a complete technical differentiation messaging kit for Archevi to communicate our data isolation and RAG advantages to both technical and non-technical audiences.

CHALLENGE:
- Technical users (r/personalfinance, developers) want deep technical details
- Families (non-technical) need simple explanations without jargon
- Compliance/privacy-conscious users want regulatory assurances
- Must translate "RAG" and "data isolation" into tangible benefits

COMPONENT 1: Privacy Advantage Explainer (3 Versions)
Create 3 versions of our privacy story tailored to different audiences:

VERSION A: TECHNICAL (for r/personalfinance, Hacker News)
- Length: 150-200 words
- Tone: Technical, detailed, uses specific terms (PIPEDA, encryption standards, self-custody)
- Key points:
  * Data isolation architecture (Docker, PostgreSQL, pgvector)
  * Data sovereignty (Canadian data stays in Canada, PIPEDA compliance)
  * Encryption (at-rest, in-transit, key management)
  * No third-party AI vendors accessing raw data (Cohere only sees embeddings, not documents)
  * SaaS transparency (code is auditable)
- Format: Technical blog post intro or Hacker News comment

VERSION B: SIMPLE (for family landing page)
- Length: 50-75 words
- Tone: Friendly, reassuring, zero jargon
- Key points:
  * Your documents stay on YOUR computer/server (not in someone else's cloud)
  * Only you can access your family's files (not even we can see them)
  * Canadian privacy laws protect you (stricter than US laws)
  * No ads, no tracking, no selling your data
- Format: Landing page hero subheadline or FAQ answer

VERSION C: EMOTIONAL (for elder care advisors, estate planners)
- Length: 100-125 words
- Tone: Professional, trust-focused, addresses fears (identity theft, data breaches)
- Key points:
  * Protect your clients' sensitive documents (SINs, wills, financial records)
  * Reduce liability (you're not storing client data in your cloud account)
  * Compliance confidence (meets Canadian privacy regulations for professional services)
  * Family peace of mind (aging parents' documents are secure)
- Format: Partner pitch deck slide or email to professional services providers

COMPONENT 2: RAG Technology Explainer (Visual + Text)
Create a simple visual explainer for "What is RAG?" targeting non-technical users:

VISUAL CONCEPT (describe what to design):
- Diagram showing 3 steps:
  1. Upload Document → "Your family photos, tax returns, medical records"
  2. AI Processes → "Creates a smart index (like a super-organized filing cabinet)"
  3. Ask Questions → "AI finds the exact answer in YOUR documents (not the internet)"
- Use simple icons (document, brain, chat bubble)
- Contrast with "Regular AI" (ChatGPT) which searches the internet, not your files
- Analogy: "RAG is like having a librarian who's read every book in your personal library"

TEXT EXPLAINER (3 paragraphs):
- Paragraph 1: The Problem (families have important documents scattered everywhere)
- Paragraph 2: How RAG Solves It (AI creates a smart index, answers questions from YOUR documents)
- Paragraph 3: Why It Matters (faster than manual search, more accurate than memory, private)

Provide:
- Visual description (enough for a designer to create the diagram)
- Text copy (ready for landing page or FAQ)
- Analogy library (5 different analogies for RAG: librarian, filing cabinet, smart assistant, etc.)

COMPONENT 3: SaaS vs Enterprise License Decision Matrix
Create a comparison matrix to help users choose between our SaaS and SaaS options:

COLUMNS:
- Feature/Consideration
- Archevi Cloud (SaaS)
- Archevi Enterprise (On-Premise)
- Who It's For

ROWS (at least 10 considerations):
- Setup Time (SaaS: 5 minutes, Enterprise deploymented: 1-2 hours)
- Technical Skill Required (SaaS: None, Enterprise deploymented: Moderate)
- Cost (SaaS: $14.99-$24.99/month, Enterprise deploymented: Free software + hosting costs)
- Data Location (SaaS: Canadian servers we manage, Enterprise deploymented: YOUR server/computer)
- Privacy (SaaS: We can't see your docs, Enterprise deploymented: 100% under your control)
- Updates (SaaS: Automatic, Enterprise deploymented: Manual)
- Support (SaaS: Included, Enterprise deploymented: Community-driven)
- Scalability (SaaS: We handle it, Enterprise deploymented: You manage)
- Customization (SaaS: Limited, Enterprise deploymented: Full code access)
- Reliability (SaaS: 99.9% uptime SLA, Enterprise deploymented: Depends on your setup)

Add a "Recommendation Engine":
- If you value convenience → SaaS
- If you value absolute control → Enterprise deploymented
- If you're privacy-paranoid → Enterprise deploymented
- If you're non-technical → SaaS
- If you're a tinkerer/developer → Enterprise deploymented

COMPONENT 4: FAQ Generator Template
Create a FAQ section addressing technical objections:

CATEGORY A: ENTERPRISE DEPLOYMENTING CONCERNS (5 FAQs)
1. "Isn't data isolation complicated?"
   - Answer: We provide Docker Compose (one command setup), detailed docs, and community support. Most users are up and running in under an hour.
2. "What if I don't have a server?"
   - Answer: You can deploy on-premise on a home computer, NAS (Synology/QNAP), or cheap cloud VPS ($5-10/month). We provide guides for each.
3. "How do I back up my data?"
   - Answer: Since you control the database, you can use standard PostgreSQL backup tools. We provide scripts and recommendations.
4. "What if I need help?"
   - Answer: Join our community forum, Discord, or GitHub Discussions. For paid support, email us.
5. "Can I migrate from deploy on-premiseed to SaaS later?"
   - Answer: Yes, we provide migration tools. Your data exports easily.

CATEGORY B: PRIVACY & SECURITY (5 FAQs)
1. "How is Archevi different from Google Drive for privacy?"
   - Answer: Google scans your files for ads and AI training. Archevi (especially deploy on-premiseed) never accesses your documents. Even our SaaS version encrypts everything and doesn't scan.
2. "Does Cohere AI see my documents?"
   - Answer: No. Cohere only sees mathematical embeddings (vectors), not the actual text. We process documents locally before sending embeddings.
3. "What happens if Archevi shuts down?"
   - Answer: Your data is in standard PostgreSQL format. Export anytime. SaaS users are unaffected (you own the code).
4. "Are you PIPEDA compliant?"
   - Answer: Yes. We follow Canadian privacy laws (PIPEDA). Data stays in Canada, we don't sell/share data, and you can request deletion anytime.
5. "Can the government access my data?"
   - Answer: SaaS: We'd require a valid warrant (Canadian law). Enterprise deploymented: No one can access without physical access to your server.

CATEGORY C: RAG TECHNOLOGY (5 FAQs)
1. "What is RAG and why should I care?"
   - Answer: RAG = smart search + AI. Instead of asking AI general questions, RAG answers from YOUR documents. Think of it as an assistant who's read your entire file cabinet.
2. "How accurate is the AI?"
   - Answer: Because RAG uses YOUR documents (not the internet), it's very accurate for your family's info. We cite sources so you can verify.
3. "Does RAG work offline?"
   - Answer: Enterprise deploymented version can work offline for search. AI features (embeddings, chat) require internet for Cohere API. We're working on fully offline mode.
4. "How much does AI cost?"
   - Answer: SaaS: Included in your plan. Enterprise deploymented: You pay Cohere directly (roughly $0.50/month per user for typical usage).
5. "Can I use a different AI model?"
   - Answer: Not yet, but it's on our roadmap. SaaS users can fork and integrate other models.

COMPONENT 5: Developer Pitch Deck (6 slides)
Create a pitch deck targeting developers/technical decision-makers:

Slide 1: COVER
- Title: "Archevi: SaaS Family Knowledge Base with RAG"
- Subtitle: "Enterprise deployment your family's documents with AI-powered search"
- Visual: Archevi logo + screenshot

Slide 2: THE TECHNICAL PROBLEM
- Families have critical documents scattered (Google Drive, email, paper)
- No good deploy on-premiseed solution (Nextcloud lacks AI, Notion isn't deploy on-premiseable, paperless-ngx is docs-only)
- Privacy concerns with cloud providers (Google/Microsoft scan files, US jurisdiction)
- Developers want to build tools for their families but don't want to start from scratch

Slide 3: ARCHEVI'S TECHNICAL SOLUTION
- Tech stack: React + Vite, Windmill (workflow engine), PostgreSQL + pgvector, Cohere AI
- Architecture: Multi-tenant SaaS OR single-tenant deploy on-premiseed (Docker Compose)
- RAG pipeline: Upload → Extract → Embed (Cohere v4) → Store (pgvector) → Query (semantic search + rerank)
- SaaS: MIT license, full code access, community-driven roadmap

Slide 4: WHY DEVELOPERS LOVE IT
- One-command deploy: `docker compose up -d`
- Hackable: Fork it, extend it, customize it (MIT license)
- Modern stack: Not PHP or legacy tech (React, PostgreSQL, TypeScript)
- API-first: All features accessible via Windmill APIs
- Community: Active GitHub, Discord, roadmap voting

Slide 5: USE CASES FOR DEVELOPERS
- Personal use: Organize your own family's docs
- Build on top: Use as a base for your own project (estate planning tool, elder care app, etc.)
- Contribute: Add features, fix bugs, improve docs (we welcome PRs)
- Deploy for others: Set up for parents/grandparents (you control it, they use it)

Slide 6: GET STARTED
- GitHub: github.com/yourorg/archevi (star us!)
- Docs: archevi.ca/docs
- Discord: Join our community

## LAB 8: Market Timing Toolkit
**Run in:** Space 8 (Emerging Trends and Timing)
**Priority:** P1 (Important for press/investor pitch)
**Estimated Time:** 15-20 minutes
**Expected Outputs:** "Why Now?" deck, trend monitor, press angles, investor deck section

### FULL PROMPT:
```
Create a comprehensive market timing toolkit for Archevi to articulate why Q1 2026 is the perfect time to launch.

CONTEXT:
- Launch: Q1 2026 (need compelling "Why Now?" narrative)
- Macro trends: Aging population, elder care crisis, digital estate planning, privacy concerns, AI hype
- Micro trends: Data isolation renaissance, SaaS models, RAG tooling maturity
- Goal: Position Archevi as riding multiple tailwinds (not early/late, but perfectly timed)

COMPONENT 1: "Why Now?" Pitch Deck (8 slides)
Create an investor/press-ready deck explaining market timing:

Slide 1: COVER
- Title: "Archevi: The Right Product at the Right Time"
- Subtitle: "Why Canadian families need a knowledge base in 2026"
- Visual: Timeline arrow pointing to 2026 with trend icons

Slide 2: THE MACRO TRENDS (3 major forces)
- Trend 1: Aging Canada (demographic data)
  * 1 in 4 Canadians will be 65+ by 2030 (Statistics Canada)
  * Elder care transitions create document chaos (estate planning, medical records, legal)
  * Pain point: Adult children scrambling to find parents' important documents
- Trend 2: Privacy Awakening (regulatory + consumer sentiment)
  * Canadian privacy laws tightening (PIPEDA, Bill C-27)
  * US cloud providers losing trust (data sovereignty concerns)
  * Pain point: Families want control, not Big Tech surveillance
- Trend 3: AI Goes Mainstream (consumer adoption)
  * ChatGPT proved AI usefulness (500M users in 2 years)
  * But: Generic AI doesn't know YOUR family's info
  * Pain point: Need AI that works on private documents, not the internet

Slide 3: THE MICRO TRENDS (3 technical enablers)
- Trend 1: Privacy-First Renaissance
  * Reddit r/personalfinance growing 40% YoY (privacy + cost concerns)
  * Tools maturing (Docker, Tailscale make data isolation easier)
  * Market ready: Non-technical users can deploy on-premise (with guides)
- Trend 2: Open-Core SaaS Success
  * Successful models: Supabase, Cal.com, Plausible (SaaS + paid hosting)
  * Proven: Developers love SaaS, families pay for convenience
  * Market ready: Dual model is validated
- Trend 3: RAG Tooling Maturity
  * 2023: RAG was experimental (LlamaIndex, LangChain early days)
  * 2024-2025: Production-ready (Cohere, Pinecone, pgvector stable)
  * 2026: Perfect timing (infrastructure mature, not yet commoditized)

Slide 4: THE CONVERGENCE (Why Now, Not Earlier/Later)
- Too Early (2022-2023):
  * RAG tooling immature (hard to build)
  * AI hype not mainstream (hard to explain)
  * Data isolation niche (market too small)
- Just Right (2026):
  * All trends converging (demographics + privacy + AI + tech maturity)
  * Market educated (people understand AI, want privacy)
  * Competition hasn't caught up (incumbents slow to adapt)
- Too Late (2027+):
  * Market saturated (too many RAG tools)
  * Big Tech catches up (Google/Microsoft add privacy features)
  * Opportunity window closes

Slide 5: MARKET SIGNALS (Proof the timing is right)
- Signal 1: Funding Activity
  * Canadian family tech funding up X% in 2024 (from uploaded data)
  * Investors betting on elder care, estate planning tools
- Signal 2: Consumer Searches
  * "How to organize family documents" searches up X% (Google Trends)
  * "Enterprise deploymented alternatives to [Google/Dropbox]" trending
- Signal 3: Competitor Moves
  * Notion, Evernote adding AI (validates market)
  * But: None offer data isolation (our differentiation)
- Signal 4: Regulatory Tailwinds
  * Canadian privacy laws favor domestic, deploy on-premiseed solutions
  * PIPEDA compliance harder for US cloud providers

Slide 6: THE URGENCY (Why families can't wait)
- Crisis Trigger 1: Elder Care Transitions
  * 10,000 Canadians turn 65 every day (boomers aging)
  * Adult children need to manage parents' documents NOW (not someday)
- Crisis Trigger 2: Tax Season, Estate Deadlines
  * Tax season (Apr), estate filings create annual pain (scramble to find documents)
  * Our launch (Q1) aligns with tax prep timing (high intent)
- Crisis Trigger 3: Data Breaches
  * Weekly headlines about cloud breaches (Dropbox, LastPass)
  * Families losing trust, seeking alternatives NOW

Slide 7: ARCHEVI'S TIMING ADVANTAGE (Why we're uniquely positioned)
- First-Mover in Canadian Family Tech
  * No direct competitor targeting Canadian families with deploy on-premiseed RAG
  * We own the category definition
- Riding Multiple Tailwinds
  * Not betting on one trend (aging OR privacy OR AI) - we benefit from ALL
  * Diversified market drivers reduce risk
- Launch Timing Perfect
  * Q1 2026: Tax season (high intent), post-holiday budgets reset, New Year's resolution energy
  * ProductHunt, media hungry for new launches (January is launch season)

Slide 8: FORWARD-LOOKING (What's next in 12-24 months)
- 12-Month Forecast (by Q1 2027):
  * Prediction 1: 5+ competitors launch RAG family tools (validates market)
  * Prediction 2: Big Tech (Google/Microsoft) adds privacy features (raises awareness, but too slow)
  * Prediction 3: Data isolation goes mainstream (1M+ Canadians deploy on-premise something)
  * Archevi's Position: Early mover advantage, brand recognition, community built
- 24-Month Forecast (by Q1 2028):
  * Prediction 1: RAG becomes table stakes (every doc tool has AI)
  * Prediction 2: Privacy regulation tightens (more PIPEDA-like laws globally)
  * Prediction 3: Open-core model standard (SaaS + deploy on-premiseed is expected)
  * Archevi's Position: Market leader in Canadian family knowledge management

For each slide, provide:
- Slide title
- Key points (3-5 bullets, quantified where possible)
- Data sources (cite uploaded documents or suggest research)
- Visual suggestions (charts, timelines, icons)
- Speaker notes (how to present this slide)

COMPONENT 3: Press Angle Bullets (10 newsworthy hooks)
Create 10 different press angles for pitching Canadian tech media:

1. DEMOGRAPHIC ANGLE
   - Hook: "As 1 in 4 Canadians turns 65, families struggle with document chaos"

   - Target outlet: Hacker News, dev-focused blogs

9. COST ANGLE
   - Hook: "Why Canadian families are ditching $20/month cloud subscriptions"
   - Archevi tie-in: Enterprise deploymented option is free (vs Google/Dropbox/iCloud)
   - Target outlet: Personal finance blogs, consumer advocacy

10. FUTURE TRENDS ANGLE
    - Hook: "The rise of 'personal AI': How families are taking control of their data"
    - Archevi tie-in: We're at the forefront of personal AI (RAG on private data)
    - Target outlet: Futurist publications, trend forecasters

For each angle, provide:
- Headline (attention-grabbing)
- Hook (1-2 sentences, newsworthy)
- Archevi connection (how we fit the story)
- Target outlet (which journalists/publications)
- Timing (when to pitch, e.g., tax season angle in March)

COMPONENT 4: Investor Deck Section (Market Timing Slides)
Create 3 slides for an investor pitch deck focused on timing:

Slide A: MARKET SIZE & GROWTH (TAM/SAM/SOM)
- TAM (Total Addressable Market): 14M Canadian households
  * Assume 50% have document management needs = 7M potential users
  * At $20 CAD/month average = $1.68B annual TAM
- SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market): 2M tech-forward families
  * Early adopters, privacy-conscious, willing to pay for tools
  * At $20 CAD/month = $480M annual SAM
- SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market): 50K users in Year 1
  * 2.5% of SAM (realistic for bootstrapped launch)
  * At $20 CAD/month = $12M annual revenue potential (Year 1 exit run-rate)
- Growth Driver: Market expanding (aging population, privacy concerns, AI adoption)

Slide B: WHY NOW? (Timing Validation)
- 3 Market Tailwinds:
  1. Demographic (10K Canadians turn 65 daily)
  2. Regulatory (PIPEDA, Bill C-27 favor local solutions)
  3. Technological (RAG mature, data isolation accessible)
- Competitor Lag: Incumbents (Notion, Evernote) slow to add data isolation
- Market Education: AI mainstream (ChatGPT), consumers ready for "personal AI"
- Our Timing Advantage: Launch Q1 2026 = ride all 3 tailwinds before market saturates

Slide C: 12-MONTH MILESTONES (Proof we can execute)
- Q1 2026: Launch (ProductHunt, 1K users, $10K MRR)
- Q2 2026: Traction (5K users, $50K MRR, 10 partnerships)
- Q3 2026: Scale (15K users, $150K MRR, Series A fundraise)
- Q4 2026: Leadership (30K users, $300K MRR, category leader in Canadian family tech)
- Key Metric: Achieve profitability by Q3 2026 (capital-efficient growth)

For each slide, provide:
- Data points (quantified, cited)
- Visual suggestions (charts, graphs)
- Investor objection handling (e.g., "Why won't Google crush you?")

FORMAT: Provide as:
- Why Now deck: 8 slides (outline format, ready for design)
- Trend monitoring dashboard: Spreadsheet (Trend | Metric | Source | Quarters | Direction)
- Press angles: 10 bullets (Hook | Archevi Tie-in | Target | Timing)
- Investor slides: 3 slides (outline format with data points)

Use data from the uploaded "Canadian Societal Trends" and "Future Trends in Family Tech" documents to support all timing claims. Quantify wherever possible (cite Statistics Canada, Google Trends, market reports).
```

### SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- ✅ "Why Now?" deck tells a compelling, data-driven timing story
- ✅ Trend monitoring dashboard is actionable (not just data collection)
- ✅ Press angles are newsworthy (not just "we launched a product")
- ✅ Investor slides address timing objections ("Why won't you be too early/late?")
- ✅ All claims are quantified with sources (not vague "market is growing" statements)

## GENERAL TIPS FOR LABS

**Before Running Labs:**
1. Ensure all files are uploaded to the Space
2. Set custom instructions (Labs uses them as context)
3. Run a test query first (confirm Space is working correctly)

**After Labs Generates Output:**
1. Download/copy all outputs immediately (Labs doesn't save history)
2. Review for accuracy (Labs sometimes hallucinates data - validate against uploaded docs)
3. Iterate if needed (use follow-up prompts to refine outputs)
4. Mark deliverable as "Complete" in tracking spreadsheet

**Common Labs Issues:**
- **Output is too generic**: Add more specific context in the prompt (e.g., "For Canadian market" or "Targeting r/personalfinance users")
- **Missing data**: Labs sometimes ignores uploaded files - explicitly reference them ("Based on the ProductHunt case studies document...")
- **Formatting issues**: Request specific formats ("Provide as a markdown table" or "Format as CSV")
- **Too long/short**: Specify length expectations ("Create a 200-word explainer" or "Provide at least 10 examples")

**Maximizing Labs Value:**
- Request multiple output formats (e.g., "Provide as both a table AND a slide outline")
- Ask for actionable next steps (e.g., "Include a checklist for implementing this")
- Request examples/templates (e.g., "Include 3 example email subject lines")
- Specify design needs (e.g., "Describe what visual to include for each slide")

**Time Estimates:**
- Simple Labs (5-10 components): 10-15 minutes
- Complex Labs (10+ components): 20-30 minutes
- Always add buffer time for review and iteration

---

**These prompts are designed to generate production-ready assets. Treat Labs outputs as first drafts that need validation (especially data points) but should be 80%+ complete.**
