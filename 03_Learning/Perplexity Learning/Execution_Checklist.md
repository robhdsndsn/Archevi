## TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: Perplexity not reading uploaded files
**Solution:** Explicitly reference files in your query: "Based on the ProductHunt case studies document..."

### Issue: Labs output is too generic
**Solution:** Add more specific context in the prompt (e.g., "For Canadian market targeting families with elder care needs")

### Issue: Data seems inaccurate
**Solution:** Cross-reference Labs output with uploaded documents. Labs sometimes hallucinates - validate all claims.

### Issue: Output format not usable
**Solution:** Request specific formats in your prompt: "Provide as a markdown table" or "Format as CSV-ready spreadsheet"

### Issue: Labs takes too long (>30 min)
**Solution:** Break complex prompts into smaller chunks. Run multiple Labs sessions instead of one massive prompt.

---

## NOTES

- **Save everything:** Labs doesn't maintain history. Download/copy outputs immediately.
- **Validate data:** Always check Labs outputs against your uploaded documents.
- **Iterate freely:** Labs allows follow-up prompts to refine outputs.
- **Work in batches:** Complete one phase before moving to next (avoid context switching).
- **Update tracking:** Mark tasks complete as you go (maintains momentum and accountability).

**This checklist transforms 20 research documents into 24+ actionable launch assets over 4 weeks.**
