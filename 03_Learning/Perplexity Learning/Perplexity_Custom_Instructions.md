3. Forecast 12-month market evolution (what changes favor us?)
4. Create press angles (newsworthy hooks tied to current events)

Use data from the trend documents."

## GENERAL TIPS FOR ALL SPACES

**Best Practices:**
1. **Start broad, then narrow**: First query should be exploratory, subsequent queries drill into specifics
2. **Reference the uploaded files explicitly**: "Based on the ProductHunt case studies document..."
3. **Ask for structured outputs**: "Create a table with columns X, Y, Z" or "Format as a checklist"
4. **Iterate on outputs**: If first response isn't detailed enough, ask "Expand on point #3 with specific examples"
5. **Request sources**: "Cite which document and section each insight comes from" (helps validate)

**Common Issues:**
- **Too generic?** → Add more context about Archevi's specific situation
- **Missing files?** → Perplexity sometimes doesn't read uploaded files - reference them explicitly in query
- **Outdated info?** → Remind Perplexity the current date is late 2025, use most recent data
- **Not actionable?** → Ask for "specific next steps" or "ready-to-use templates"

**Time-Saving Tips:**
- Use "Create a [type] for [purpose]" format (e.g., "Create a checklist for validating pricing")
- Request markdown or CSV outputs (easier to copy into other tools)
- Ask for "copy-paste ready" templates (emails, social posts, etc.)
- For long outputs, request "part 1 of 3" structure (keeps responses focused)
